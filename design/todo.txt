1. Can't escape curly braces:
 "dependencies": \{{{#if isAntdIncluded}}
    "antd": "^3.26.15",
    {{/if}}


 2. Only for Local Template: The /node_modules folder is ignored in .gitignore file, but still we needed to ignore this folder in .boilerplatoignore file otherwise the app is very slow.
 Steps to replicate:
    1. ignore node_modules in .gitignore file and create an empty .boilerplatoignore file
    2. Now generate the app
    3. The app will be slow
 Workaround
    1. Add "/node_modules" in .boilerplatoignore file as well
